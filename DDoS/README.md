# DDoS Simulation in a Software Defined Network
This project aims to provide a basic framework for DDoS mitigation using Deep reinforcement learning. The network is implemented using Mininet (based on Software defined networking).

The design of the solution is inspired by the work "Deep Reinforcement Learning based Smart Mitigation of DDoS Flooding in Software-Defined Networks" by Yandong Liu and others [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8514971).

## Getting Started
Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/santhisenan/SDN_DDoS_Simulation.git
```
## Prerequisites
Install dependencies

* Install Mininet
* Install OpenVSwitch
* Install Ryu 
* Install Tensorflow
* Install Keras

* Clone ryu repository and copy  ryu/ryu folder to SDN_DDoS_Simulation root

## Testing
Modify simple_tree_top.py according to test purpose
```
cd SDN_DDoS_Simulation
python simple_tree_top.py
```
Open a new Terminal tab
```
PYTHONPATH=. ryu/ryu/bin/ryu-manager main.py
```
## Running
```
cd SDN_DDoS_Simulation
python tree_topology.py
```
Open a new Terminal tab
```
PYTHONPATH=. ryu/ryu/bin/ryu-manager main.py
```
